# Pharmacy Odoo Desktop App ðŸ’Š
This is a Dockerized Odoo application designed to run locally on one machine. It works as a POS, inventory system, and expiration tracker for medicines. There is an easy import/export button so that data from the store can be gathered for and processed in the main office. This was created for the use of our family business.
